This project contains an eCommerce dataset that I will explore using SQL on Google BigQuery. The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website.

# II. Exploring the Dataset
In this project, I will write 08 query in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset

## Query 01: calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)


V. Conclusion
In conclusion, my exploration of the eCommerce dataset using SQL on Google BigQuery based on the Google Analytics dataset has revealed several interesting insights.
By exploring eCommerce dataset, I have gained valuable information about total visits, pageview, transactions, bounce rate, and revenue per traffic source,.... which could inform future business decisions.
To deep dive into the insights and key trends, the next step will visualize the data with some software like Power BI,Tableau,...
Overall, this project has demonstrated the power of using SQL and big data tools like Google BigQuery to gain insights into large datasets.
